### Project Overview

Problem Statement-
      Students often feel a huge gap between what is taught in college and what they have to do in the real world. Is there a solution         to bridge the gap without them taking help of extra courses online.
      
Solution-
      We built a platform named Xnary - A dictionary of professional's experience, where students can search about the topics they study      in class and get information about how these are being implemented in real world applications by posts,research works and      documentations from their professors,other professionals and also exclusive content from Xnary*.
